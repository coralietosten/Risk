"""
Several strategies are provided in order to attack an opponent army.

Notice that the pre- and post-conditions of these functions would not need to be tested.
They are already ensured by the strategies.
However, they are repeated to the programmer for clarity and documentation.
Also, this allows to detect a possible flaw closer to its source.
A model is given below.
Notice that post-conditions can be strengthen.
